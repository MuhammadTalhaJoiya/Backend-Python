kafka => event streaming through topic
the service which run on server have two main thing first is main service and second is metadata
*metadat stores the data
*kRAFT metadata
*streaming is segment bases and many bytes combine to form segment
*kafka provide use coupling
*topic and partision both are metadata 
* younger brother is consider to be partision 
*there are two way to communicate between microservices first is synchronise which is restapi and second is asynchronous which is acheived by apachi kafka
*kafka is event streaming distribution platform
*kafka is a broker and it is server if two broker is in project then there is two server running on it
*In kafka there might be have multiple topics and multiple topics might be contain "replica partision" or "leader partision" in itself
*in asynchronous architecture there are 4 ways to communicate with the client from server
1:by giving order id to client and giving the email to client for furthur info
2:web socket,it takes data from server to client on every event firing
3:server side event which listen on client
4:polling,client request continiously for the result
